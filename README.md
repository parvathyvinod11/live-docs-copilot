# Live Documentation Copilot

An agentic AI system that continuously reasons over live, evolving documentation.

## What it does
- Monitors documentation in real time
- Detects breaking changes instantly
- Reacts without re-indexing or retraining

## Why it matters
Traditional RAG systems rely on static snapshots and return stale answers when documentation changes.

This system uses Pathway’s streaming engine to maintain an always-up-to-date knowledge state.

## How to run
```bash
python app.py
